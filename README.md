# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub page. This is where you can see what I'm currently working on. Have a look around! (I apologize for the mess)

## Who am I?
My name is Jonas and I am a software engineering student at Oslo Metropolitan University. I've always loved technology and programming, which is why I chose to study software engineering.
I love understanding how things work, and can never stop myself from investigating something I don't understand. **If you are a potential employer reviewing job candidates you may skip to the next paragraph.** That means I am probably sometimes a pain to deal with if I can't figure something out or if I'm forced to accept some technique or method without knowing _why_.

In addition to attending OsloMet, I am also the corporate contact and event manager at [Ditio, the student association for IT students.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ditio-linjeforening)

## Focus - philosophical
I aspire to work as a software engineer. That means more than just wiriting programs for clients. It means taking into account ethical, societal and practical considerations to deliver software that's not only functonal, but also maintainable and well documented. Good software can evolve with the needs of the client and can be passed to other developers with little friction.

I have great interest in finding "proper" solutions to problems. More and more I find myself prefering acclaimed literature and official documentation over less formal sources like blogs or guides. That is not to take away from the wonderful part of the software space that is sharing and helping each other - it's just often important to check and harden knowledge with official sources to avoid pitfalls like security holes and solutions that only work _sometimes_.

I also like efficiency. Even though we increasingly write software(such as web apps) that don't take performance into consideration I find this stupid. There are often tools available that enable solving the same problem while doing so efficiently. Just because modern hardware is fast, there is still energy-consumption and scalability to consider. Of course there are situations where it's okay to write a webserver in Python, but I find more interest in compiled languages with static typing. It's more satisfying to work with. This will likely explain many of the technologies, languages and techniques I prefer using in my work.

## Focus - concrete
Currently, I am learning Rust. I like its unique position as a fast, compiled language with safe guards you would often only find in slower, interpreted languages. I am also trying to learn more about functional languages. This is not just about efficiency in terms of raw excecution speed, but about efficiency in terms of development time. Functional programming is a type of programming that can provide guarantees like safe concurrency, easy testability and more. Therefore, I consider it important to learn about(even if I may not end up working with it on a daily basis). I use Haskell.

In addition I should mention nix, which is a purely functional language drawing heavily on haskell for its inspiration. It is however unique in that it is not primarily intended as a general purpose programming language. It is turing complete, but its purpose is declaring and defining system configurations, development environments, and much more. In general it provides a lot of great tooling involved in software development. I use it for all my projects, as well as for configuring all my machines, which run [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)(linux distro based on the Nix package manager that is used with the nix programming language).

Recently I've been focusing on learning more about the practical use cases of nix, using a simple web project as a testing platform for learning about development environments, application packaging, integratino testing and deployment. All of this and more can be declaratively managed with nix.

## Other focuses
Being a software engineering student, I learn about project management, development processeses, algortihms, data strucutres, databases, programming, operating systems, cloud services, networking and more.

## Work
I'm actively looking for a job opportunity within software engineering. I'd be happy to consider an offer, especially(but not exclusively) if it coincides with my interests in the field. You can reach me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-baugerud/).
